Linkar Framework C libraries
============================

There are 4 folders:
- DLL
- LIB
- linux.a
- linux.so

The "DLL" and "LIB" folders are the dynamic and static libraries for Windows.
The "linux.a" and "linux.so" are the dynamic and static libraries for linux.

Inside each folder there are other 2 folders: x64 and x86 with the compiled libraries for platform x64 and x86

There is only one private library: Linkar.dll / Linkar.lib / libLinkar.so / libLinkar.a

The other libraries are open free in https://github.com/kosday/Linkar_C_Framework
