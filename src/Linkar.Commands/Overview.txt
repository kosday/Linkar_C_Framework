Title: Library Overview

Dependencies: *Linkar*

This library is the SendCommand function with small variants:

	- Executing Persistent or Direct operations. 
	- Executing specified commands in XML or JSON.

A command is nothing more than a string of characters where an operation is specified (E.g.. Read) with all its mandatory and optional parameters described in XML or JSON format.
