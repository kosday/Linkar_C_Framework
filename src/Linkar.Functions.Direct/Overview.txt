Title: Library Overview

Dependencies: *Linkar*, *Linkar.Functions*

This library consists of one function for each possible operation in Linkar Server (Read, New, Update, Select, Subroutine, ...)

The executed operation is a Direct type one. In these operations, you can specify the desired output format, and in those operations that also allows it, the data input format.

The basic input and output formats are XML, JSON, MV, or TABLE.

You could even specify different formats for data input and output.

Not all operations allow input/output type formats.
