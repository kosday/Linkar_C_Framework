This library consists of one function for each possible operation in Linkar Server (Read, New, Update, Select, Subroutine…).

The operation is of a Persistent type.

Two functions are also included to carry out the “Login” and “Logout” operations.

The desired output format can also be specified in these operations, and the data input format can be also specified in those operations that allow it.

The basic input and output formats are XML, JSON, MV, or TABLE.

Different formats for data input and output can also be specified.

Not all operations have all types of input/output formats.
