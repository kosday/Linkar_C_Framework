Title: Library Overview

Dependencies: *Linkar*, *Linkar.Functions*

This library consists of one function for each possible operation in Linkar Server (Read, New, Update, Select, Subroutine…)

The operation is of Persistent type.

Two functions are also included to carry out the “Login” and “Logout” operations.

In these operations, you can specify the desired output format, and in those operations that also allows it, the data input format.

The basic input and output formats are XML, JSON, MV, or TABLE. You could even specify different formats for data input and output.

Not all operations have all types of input/output formats.
